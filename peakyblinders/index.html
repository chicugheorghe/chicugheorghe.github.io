          Anatomy of the series: "Peaky Blinders" Peaky Blinders watch online
          Steven Knight was inspired to create the series by these guys. Always
          immaculately dressed in branded jackets, tailored cuffed coats,
          button-down vests, silk scarves, leather boots, and of course caps
          with visors, they were more like a small army that kept more than just
          their hometown at bay. The history of this gang is shrouded in mystery
          and has given rise to so many theories that it is now difficult to say
          exactly where the truth is hidden. According to Stephen Knight, his
          parents caught the Peaky Blinders during a period of activity. When
          the gang ruled the streets of Birmingham, Knight's father was only ten
          years old. Subsequently, he often told his son stories about them.
          These stories are imprinted in children's memory for a long time.
          Stephen Knight said in an interview that he wanted to show these tough
          guys through the eyes of a child. "Peaky Blinders" is the story of a
          family that rose from the bottom and gained unprecedented influence
          not only at home. Since the end of World War I, Birmingham has been in
          decline. Its streets are in chaos. Yesterday's soldiers and communist
          revolutionaries, inveterate thugs and IRA fighters, bandits and hard
          workers - everything is mixed up. This is a great opportunity for the
          Peaky Blinders to seize control of the city. The core of the group is
          the four Shelby brothers and their aunt Polly Grey. In the first
          seasons, the elder brother Arthur was considered the official head - a
          cruel man, prone to bouts of uncontrolled aggression. He was the
          "face" of the Peaky Blinders - dangerous, reckless and bloodthirsty,
          inspiring fear. In fact, the real leader of the group was the middle
          brother Thomas (Tommy) Shelby. After returning from the front, he
          changed dramatically. The war left an indelible mark on him, but Tommy
          remembers what strong feelings are when he meets Grace. He runs a
          family business in the shadow of his older brother and is trying with
          all his might to legalize it in order to bring the group to a new
          level. Charismatic, ambitious, cruel and cold-blooded Tommy is
          definitely not one of the positive characters. "Peaky Blinders" take
          on any job: they are engaged in street robberies, murders, organize an
          underground sweepstakes and sell their patronage to merchants. On
          their way, the gang members face serious opponents. They are trying to
          force out other groups of Italians and Jews. Even having dealt with
          competitors, Shelby can only dream of a peaceful sleep, because the
          police are also on the alert. Inspector Chester Campbell receives a
          direct order from Winston Churchill himself. The peace officer must
          clear the streets of the city from the bandits and return the batch of
          weapons stolen from the factory, but even the detention of the head of
          the Peaky Blinders does not give any results. Then Campbell decides to
          act more cunningly and sophisticatedly. He introduces his people into
          the group, hoping one day to catch Shelby hot. The family business is
          growing steadily. Now the Peaky Blinders have taken up gambling in
          earnest. Birmingham is getting too crowded, so Tommy is trying to
          expand his sphere of influence and move to the capital, but there he
          is waiting for a group led by Alfie Solomons, who is not happy with
          ambitious competitors. In addition, the Shelbys become embroiled in
          the affairs of the secret civil service and the rebels from the IRA.
          Tommy marries Grace Burgess and introduces her to the family. Russian
          aristocrats appear on the horizon, who fled their country after the
          victory of the Bolsheviks. The cruel Arthur changes drastically after
          his marriage to the God-fearing Linda. "Peaky Blinders" are gradually
          pouring into the circles of high British society, but it is impossible
          to completely abandon the life of a street gang. Grace is killed in a
          random shootout. Tommy's wife turned out to be completely different
          from the woman she claimed to be. One of Shelby's younger brothers,
          Johnny, comes to the fore. The older guy acts more and more
          confidently and makes it clear to the rest of the family that he is
          ready to pick up the banner of the family if something happens to
          Tommy or Arthur.
